# Local REST API

Use this to have a locally running REST API that accepts JSON.

This was made as a simple replacement for JSONBox.io.

## Pre-installation steps

In the installation process your shell will try to run a certain command. This
command needs to be able to clone repositories from Github using an SSH key.

To check if you can already do this try to run the following command from your terminal:

`git clone git@github.com:WincAcademy/local_api.git`

If this works you can continue on to installation.

If this does _not_ work you'll get an error like `Could not read from remote repository`. This means you need to take the following steps:

1. [generate an SSH key pair](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key)
2. [add your private key to your SSH agent](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent)
3. give your _public key_ [to Github](https://github.com/settings/keys)

This command should now work:
`git clone git@github.com:WincAcademy/local_api.git`

line.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line)

## Installation

When you've done that take the following steps:

- make sure you're using node >= 14
- git clone this repository
- `cd local_api`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

The app will start on port 3000. Make sure the port is part of the URL you send
requests to. For example: a GET request to
`http://localhost:3000/`

## Sending HTTP requests to this API

You can send 4 kinds of HTTP requests to this app.

All but the `delete` requests need to have the content-type header set to
`application/json`.

### POST

To create an item send a POST request with a JSON object in the body to `/`. The
return value will be the newly created object and HTTP status 201.

```json
{
  "name": "Ernie",
  "color": "orange",
  "mood": "happy",
  "_id": "f5408a45-b4d0-4aee-8530-c2250481b131",
  "_createdOn": "2021-01-25T14:53:49.322Z"
}
```

Each item gets an auto generated id and a `_createdOn` attribute.

### GET

To read all items send a GET request to `/`. The return value will be the list
of all created objects and HTTP status 200.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Ernie",
    "color": "orange",
    "mood": "happy",
    "_id": "f8636d68-e656-4c2e-ac99-a625f35a25f9",
    "_createdOn": "2021-01-25T14:59:50.834Z"
  },
  {
    "name": "Bert",
    "color": "yellow",
    "mood": "grumpy",
    "_id": "b0092da7-363f-4c20-859b-b6d4c008dcb3",
    "_createdOn": "2021-01-25T15:00:02.403Z"
  }
]
```

To read a single item send a GET request to `/{id_of_the_item}`. The return
value will be the item, if it exists, and HTTP status 200.

```json
{
  "name": "Bert",
  "color": "yellow",
  "mood": "grumpy",
  "_id": "b0092da7-363f-4c20-859b-b6d4c008dcb3",
  "_createdOn": "2021-01-25T15:00:02.403Z"
}
```

### PUT

To update an item send a PUT request with a body to `/{id_of_the_item}`. The
body should contain the updated item. The return value will be the updated item
and HTTP status 200.

```json
{
  "name": "Groover",
  "color": "green",
  "mood": "hungry",
  "_id": "b0092da7-363f-4c20-859b-b6d4c008dcb3",
  "_createdOn": "2021-01-25T15:00:02.403Z",
  "_updatedOn": "2021-01-25T15:04:04.194Z"
}
```

An updated item gets an `_updatedOn` attribute.

### DELETE

To delete an item send a DELETE request to `/{id_of_the_item}`. The return value
will be HTTP 204.

## Deleting the database

If you want to start over:

- stop the app by pressing `Control/Ctrl + C` in the terminal where you ran `npm start`
- delete the files in `database/`
- start the app
